## What to do after PSLE

Hello, Primary 6 students! ðŸ‘‹


We have came to the end of out PSLE. What should we do next?

This post will tell you almost all the things you will need to do.

## 1. Play!

I am very, VERY sure that as the exams are over, fun comes in. Play for a good amount of time, whether its watching the television or just laying flat on your bed. Do whatever you want!

However, it doesnt mean that that lasts forever. Dont overplay, like eight or more. Dont forget that health still matters!

## 2. Secondary school chosing

On the first week of december, You will need to choose for your six secondary schoools. With not even a month left, you should start to plan for your schools.

## What to do

Apprenly, 18/11 and 25/11 are two days where many secondary school open houses occur. Choose wisely where to go, and roam extensively in the school campus.

You can also do a side by side comparsion of two schools, and see which school has more advantages that suit you. Factors are location, distance, CCA, LLP, ALP, AL score and much more. These usually can be found in the secondary school's website.

Well, thats all! Just remember, your first day of school starts on the first five days of January 2024.
