## What to do after PSLE

Hello, Primary 6 students! ðŸ‘‹

We have came to the end of our PSLE. What should we do next?

This post will tell you almost all the things you will need to do.

## 1. Play!

I am very, VERY sure that as the exams are over, fun comes in. Play for a good amount of time, whether its watching the television or just laying flat on your bed. Do whatever you want!

However, it doesnt mean that that lasts forever. Dont overplay, like eight or more. Dont forget that health still matters!

## 2. Secondary school chosing

On the first week of december, You will need to choose for your six secondary schoools. With not even a month left, you should start to plan for your schools.

## What to do

Apprenly, 18/11 and 25/11 are two days where many secondary school open houses occur. Choose wisely where to go, and roam extensively in the school campus.

You can also do a side by side comparsion of two schools, and see which school has more advantages that suit you. Factors are location, distance, CCA, LLP, ALP, AL score and much more. These usually can be found in the secondary school's website.

Well, thats all! Just remember, your first day of school starts on the first five days of January 2024.

## 3. What to expct in S1

Secondary school is fun. With more than double(or even triple!) of the subject that you can learn, the posibillities are limitless. There is also schools which have special subjects.

Oriention

Every first few days of the school day, you would never get a mountain of homework. Instead, you probably would gat the complete opposite treatment.

i)School familiarity

You would need to get familiar to the school campus. Sec school campuses are much larger than in primary school. If not, you can get into an infinite maze.

ii)Classmates

Friends are important. Without friends, it is very hard to interact and get help. Try to remember their names and help, teach, entertain or do whatever it takes to get a friend. You can also try to make friends from other classes!

iii) Personal device
In secondary school, there is a programme(not all schools) that allow you to use a personal laptop/tablet to do assist you in your learning process. A laptop! On your table! Imaging that!

There are also many other things that you can do. Some schools might also have a chilling zone that might have a racing simulator or even have a PS5, Nitendo switch and much more!!!

From this post, I hope that you can enjoy your secondary school to the fullest. Once i mention again, there are many oppotunities in secondary school. Good Luck on your PSLE results and have fun in secondary school!
